# Lux

Description:
-----------
Lux is a community dedicated to promoting education and topics such as healthcare and technology through the use of digital multimedia. This includes digital art, photography, videography, music production, and much more. As Lux is an inter-university club that is available in universities all across Ontario (uOttawa, Carleton, McMaster, Western, University of Toronto and more), the club was lacking a website that promotes the club and its mission.

As a club executive of Lux at Carleton University, I decided to design and develop a website that would provide more information about the club and how to join, the projects that members of the club are either working on or have been completed, and contact information.
